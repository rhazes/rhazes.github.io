Biotinis is a genome cookbook of recipes to modify human physical traits. 
The recipes describe enhancement modifications to target regions in genes associated with traits such as, metabolic rate, eye color, and genes believed to associated with intelligence. 
These targets were identified from molecular biology and genetics research literature.
The genes in the recipes are the DNA and protein sequences that have been associated with the corresponding traits.
 recipes are derived from molecular biology and genetic research findings. 

 Conceptually the cookbook marries people's obsession with control with our decreasing appetite for complexity.  Consider interactions with popular science and technology today: three-minute sound-bites on complex medical issues; grossly trivialized treatments of complex research findings (e.g. "drink red wine to live longer"); mildly informative pharmaceutical commercials that spend more time warning of side effects than benefits, yet still encourage consumers to prompt their doctors to prescribe them.
