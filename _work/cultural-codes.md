The core concept of the project was an investigation into the practice of living culture within contemporary M&#257;ori art forms. Parametric structures based on traditional M&#257;ori weaving patterns were designed for an installation in Tokyo Designers Week. Te Whare Pora (Tay - Fa-ray Pu Rah) was a core theme of the design process and the final installation space.

_"Te Whare Pora is held as a place of artistic mastery and the knowledge passed from one generation to the next is enriched with the wisdom and mana gained from those who it came from. The goal of the exhibition is to immerse the participant into the mindset of the master weaver at work; therefore being introduced to Te Whare Pora as physical space and a state-of-mind."_
