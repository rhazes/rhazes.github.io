_The young dissident naturally wanted to play tricks - and misuse all technology. That's how electronic music was born. We started making music with devices made for other purposes. Technology won't take control as long as man can misuse it._

Forks in Sockets brings together people that are interested in doing strange things with electricity in a cross-disciplinary context. In 2012 engineer Josh Bailey, media artist Anne Niemetz and sonic artist Dugal McKinnon first brought musicians and engineers together to perform with and through the Tesla coil. 

The project has since grown as an experimental playground for science and art, and now includes engineers, contemporary composers, designers and artists.

Forks in Sockets was the first public performance in which the exciting results of these interdisciplinary collaborations are shared with the public.

##Visuals
I designed and performed the visuals for Forks and Sockets. The concept behind the visuals was human fascination with the mythical powers of science and nature.
Throughout history humans have been enthralled with the awesome power and beauty of scientific processes as they manifest in nature. This fascination has led to various experiments to control and direct scientific processes for enhanced productivity, on one hand, and to create awe-inspiring demonstrations on the other. These experiments are simultaneously the genesis of innovation, production, destruction and demise.

The visuals are an edited and curated mix of historical depictions of control mechanisms from the laboratories of "mad scientist" characters in famous films, and real-time generated computer graphics responding to the rhythm and volume of the Tesla coil.
