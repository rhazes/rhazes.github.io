Genome Tiles is an ambient data art piece installed at the Duke University Center for Interdisciplinary Engineering Medicine and Science.  The tiles encode genes implicated in the expression pathways of human diseases that researchers were investigating. The BRCA1 gene is associated with [hereditary breast and ovarian cancer ](http://www.malacards.org/card/brca1_and_brca2_hereditary_breast_and_ovarian_cancer?search=brca1).  Mutations in BRCA1 are predicted to be responsible for more than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancers. The genetic sequence for BRCA1 is encoded in the buildings ladies' restrooms. The BMP1 gene is responsible for proper formation of cartilage. Mutations in BMP1 are associated with [Osteogenesis Imperfecta](http://www.malacards.org/card/bmp1_related_osteogenesis_imperfecta). The genetic sequence for BMP1 is encoded in the building men's restroom.
