This is an ambient data art piece. The tile color and order correspond to 2 genes researched at Duke University: BRCA1 - breast cancer and BMP1 - bone morphogenic protein. The genes were selected for their societal importance. Mutations in BRCA1 are predicted to be responsible for more than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancers. BMP1 encodes a protein that forms cartilage.
