hear.listen is a 2-channel video piece that was exhibited at the 2012 UCLA MFA Thesis Show, Unstable. The piece is based on a neurotic habit that causes me to alternatively tangle my hair and pull out knots. hear, is shot unlit with an audio of the hair tangling/pulling cycle. listen, is shot lit without audio. Hair harvested by this process over 2 years was used to construct the LPs that were used in [DJ Incognegro's](http://rhaz.es/is/dj-incognegro) performance and displayed as [LP](http://rhaz.es/made/lp).
