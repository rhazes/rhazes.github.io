LP is an album constructed from my hair. 

LPs are playable (see [DJ Incognegro](http://rhaz.es/made/dj-incognegro)).  

Hair is readily interpreted as an identifier either socially through the relationship between hair styling and (sub)culture or as containers of biochemical identification in the form of DNA and records of one's chemical ingestion.  

LP is the answer to the question, 'what's the sound of my hair's record?'

LP was exhibited at the 2012 UCLA MFA Thesis Show, Unstable.
