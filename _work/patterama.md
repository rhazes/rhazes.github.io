Patterama was an event held at New Zealand Parliament for the [New Zealand Gifted Kid's Program](http://www.giftedchildren.org.nz/). I was invited to give the keynote address and exhibit a piece. Game of Life was an interactive installation that allowed participants to play with the John Conway's famous cellular automata algorithm, [Conway's Game of Life][gameoflife].

Since it's public introduction over 50 years ago mathematician, biologists, computer scientists and others have studied the rich variety of patterns that are generated from this simple system.  The exhibition introduced participants to this world through "playing cards" that gave pattern recipes for different systems. Participants entered the card patterns or their own patterns into a custom iPad interface and their system was played through a large scale projection.
