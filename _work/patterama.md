In 2012 I gave the keynote address for the New Zealand Gifted Kids Program Patterama conference. The event was held at Parliament and in addition to my address I did an installation, G.O.L (Game of Life). The installation was an implementation of John Conway's [Game of Life][gameoflife] in Processing with a custom interface designed using [Lemur][lemur] on the iPad. Conference attendees enter starting patterns through the interface and the results of the "game" were projected. G.O.L playing cards were designed to introduce participants to different classes of patterns that have been studied in the Game of Life.
