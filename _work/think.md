For their centennial celebration IBM commissioned THINK, a globally travelling exhibition, celebrating the human spirit of discovery and the potential of innovative applications of scientific discovery to solve global challenges. The exhbition opened at Lincoln Center in Manhatten, NY in the fall of 2011. I was fortunate to work on this project with a team of extremely talented producers, directors and artists from [Mirada](http://mirada.com).

My piece, 'Traffic', was a chapter in 5 chapter data narrative (including finance, air quality, solar energy  and water ) about New Yorkers. The Traffic chapter tells the story of NY traffic in 2 parts. Part 1 is an agent-based animation. The agents in the animation are intelligently programmed with varying aggressive driving behaviors that eventually results in grid locked traffic. Part 2 utilizes real time traffic data from the intersection of Broadway and Lincoln afternoons to visualize the traffic. The traffic is rendered as a knot that dynamically changes its 'knottiness' to reflect the current level of traffic and the traffic levels over the prior 24 hours.

You can watch the production video [here](http://mirada.com/stories/ibm).

The event was well received and reviewed. Below are some write-up.
