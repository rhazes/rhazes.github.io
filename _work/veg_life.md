Veg Life is a video piece that resulted from my fascination with alternative diets. The genesis of the project was an exploration of myths around protein consumption and meat. During the process I found exploring myths of masculinity and virility tied to diet to be more fascinating. In particular how these myths relate(d) to my narratives.
