### about
I am a tinkerer and artist interested in creative expression at the intersection of science, technology and society. I am particularly interested in how innovation, technology, and science (re)define us.  

I work across media and I am particularly interested in installation, performance, kinetic and interactive art that stimulates us, questions us, plays with us and laughs at us.
